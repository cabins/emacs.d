# About this project


This is `NOT` a part of [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) but a personal configuration maintained by Â© Cabins from China.

This repo is for Emacs in termux environment on Android tablet or phone, yes, I sometimes use them for programming.

# Target

1. For Emacs in termux
2. Lightweight oriented

# About Programming language

Thanks to Eglot, we can program in Emacs (almost) perfectly.

And why NOT lsp-mode? It has too many dependecies, some of them NOT work on termux, e.g `s` package.

# 1-2-3

1. Just run the code below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cabins/termux-emacs ~/.emacs.d
```

2. And then launch your Emacs, wait for the package installation finish.
3. Enjoy the life.
