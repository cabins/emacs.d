;;; early-init.el --- Emacs 27 introduces early-init.el, which runs before init.el
;;; Commentary:
;; Runs before package and UI initializetion happens.
;;; Code:

;; For speed up the startup, please do NOT forget reset it to default
;; after Emacs after-init-hook, or it may cause freezes.

;; Prevent unwanted runtime compilation for native-comp users
(setq native-comp-deferred-compilation nil)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is loaded
;; but after `early-init-file'. If you want to handle package initialization,
;; you can prevent Emacs from doing it early by uncomment next line!

;; [From DOOM Emacs]
;; In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
